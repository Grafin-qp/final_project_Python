# final_project_Python
Final task for the course of Python in HSE University

This code is a parser for the Central Bank site. The user is prompted to choose which of five documents he wants to upload and turn into a database. After unloading, the code picks one of the prepared parsing algorithms into a json file and creates a database.

I am preparing to pass IELTS, so all the text, with the exception of files names will be written in English.
